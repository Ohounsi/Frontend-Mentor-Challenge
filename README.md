## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./Screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

On this project I learnt how to position div elements side by side in multiple ways, which include: Grid display; using the hide comments between div statements in HTML; manipulating the position properties etc.

I also learnt from Jeanette Watts @JeanetteW how to manipulate certain properties within a div in CSS without having to create a class or id for the said properties.


### Useful resources

- https://coder-coder.com/display-divs-side-by-side/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to position div elements beside each other. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
